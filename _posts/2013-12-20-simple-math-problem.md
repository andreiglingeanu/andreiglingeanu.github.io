Simple math problem:
Use each of the numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6 exactly once with any
of the four basic math operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division) to total 24. Each number must be
used once and only once, and you may define the order of
operations; for example, 3 * (4 + 6) + 1 = 31 is valid, however
incorrect, since it doesnâ€™t total 24.

Response:
6 / (1 - 3 / 4) = 24
